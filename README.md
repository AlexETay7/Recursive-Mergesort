# Recursive-Mergesort
I implemented a recursive mergesort sorting algorithm in java. The mergesort is used to sort objects in a list that implements the IndexedUnsortedList interface. I implemented the mergesort algorithm twice, once using the compareTo method, and once using the compare() method of a comparator.
